# System Design

## Fundamentals

### Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems

1. **Scalability** is the capability of a system, process, or a network to grow and manage increased demand.

  * **Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling** Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM, Storage, etc.) to an existing server.
  
  * Good example of horizontal scaling are **Cassandra** and **MongoDB**.
  * Good example of vertical scaling is **MySQL**.

2. **Reliability**


3. **Availability**


4. **Efficiency**


5. **Manageability**


### Load Balancing
* Caching
* Data Partitioning
* Indexes
* Proxies
* Redundancy and Replication
* SQL vs. NoSQL
* CAP Theorem
* Long-Polling vs WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events
